## What is ML?
Machine learning (ML) is the study and the use of computer algorithms that can improve itself through experience and by the use of data. It is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves computers discovering how they can perform various tasks. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand. For the advanced tasks, it can be challenging to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having programmers specify every needed step.
